## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the ridership of "CitiBikes" in New York City to determine if this would be a successful venture in Des Moines.

## Results

The results of the analysis can be found here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/derek.petersen/viz/BootCampModule14/Story1?publish=yes)

The charts above shows the average duration of each trip.  Regardless of gender, a large majority of trips are short-only 1-20 minutes.

Looking at the time trips occure, most appear to be used for the work commute - around 8am then again around 5pm in the evening.  This is consistent regardless of gender.

The chart above show the daily usage by user type - either Customer or Subscriber.  This reiterates that male ridership is drastically higher.  One could suspect that "Customer usage would drastically increase on the weekends, however the data shows that ridership for "Customers is rather consistent regardless of weekdays.

The two charts above show the starting and ending points of rides.  Given the consistency of start and end points - this would also support that riders are using them for their commutes as there is a lot of consistency.

## Summary
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

In summary, further analysis of the Des Moines area would need to be completed prior to supporting this business venture.  In New York, a vast majority of riders appear to be males riding to and from work.  Further analysis that could be done with this dataset are:
1. Digging into the ridership by age.  Using the birth year you could create a calculated measure and chart the average ridership by age.  
2. Bike repairs.  In the current analysis (done in the module) the chart showing rides by bike is really not helpful in showing which bikes are ridden most often.  Another way to visuallize this would be to put it in a vertical bar chart sorted by number of rides.
